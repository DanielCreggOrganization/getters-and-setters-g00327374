<strong>Encapsulation</strong> describes the ability of an object to hide its data and methods from the rest of the world and is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. In Java, a class encapsulates the fields, which hold the state of an object, and the methods, which define the actions of the object. Encapsulation enables you to write reusable programs. It also enables you to restrict access only to those features of an object that are declared public. All other fields and methods are private and can be used for internal object processing.

<strong>Lab Steps</strong>

1. Add 2 instance variables to the Person class.
2. Add getter and setter methods to the Person class. 
3. Add the main method to Main class.  
4. Create a Person object.  
5. Set all instance variables of the Person object.
6. Print all instance varibales of the Person object using a print statement and getter methods.
7. Add the default constructor to the Person class.
8. Add the paramiterized constructor to the Person class.
9. Create a Student class
10. Add two private instance variables to the Students class
11. Write the getters and setters for the Students class
12. Write the paramiterized constructor for the Student class
13. Inside the Main class create a students object and set default values for all variables.
14. Print all Students object details to the console.
15. Create a study method inside the student class that prints "I am studying to the console". Then call this method in the main class.
